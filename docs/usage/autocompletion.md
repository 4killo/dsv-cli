Autocomplete is a convenience feature to help type commands, subcommands, flags, and secret paths faster.
It is supported on bash, zsh, and fish shells via [complete](https://github.com/posener/complete).

To enable autocomplete:

```shell
dsv -install
```

To disable it:

```shell
dsv -uninstall
```
