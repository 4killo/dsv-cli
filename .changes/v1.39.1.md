## v1.39.1 - 2022-11-14

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- The project go module has been renamed from `thy` to GitHub canonical name format `github.com/DelineaXPM/dsv-cli`.
  This will also allow better support for installing the latest version of cli via `go install github.com/DelineaXPM/dsv-cli@latest` as an option.

### ðŸ¤– Development

- Update `master` branch default for the repository to `main` to align with better industry inclusive naming practices.
- Testing is now able to be run on unit tests immediately.
  Integration tests now check for required environment variable `GO_INTEGRATION_TEST` to opt-in to tests, rather than requiring filtering out.
- Remove `fmt` blocking test. This is now covered by `golangci-lint` tooling run by trunk if required. Current tests flag vendor directory incorrectly.
